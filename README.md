# The Amazing (Programming) Race!

## Program Summary:
This program tests the speed and compile times 9 different programming languages! It keeps the competition fair between the race by givng each language its own thread
to execute on. The test that each language must pass in the the Sieve of Eratosthenes, an algorithm that calculates prime numbers up to a specified range. The race portion is covered by a parameter called the pass count, this represents the number of times each language must run the Sieve. After the pass count has been reached, it must also test the validity of the results, ensuring each and every number marked as prime, is truly prime! Then the winner is crowned!

## Languages:
- C++
- Python
- Rust
- Julia
- R
- Go
- Perl

## Future Work:
- Planning on adding Ada and Fortran
- Even more languages than those above would be exciting!
